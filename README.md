# Discord-bot-ChuckNorrisFunctionality

This is a litle ten-minute project that I did as a way to try the requests module in python.

<h3>What does it do?</h3>
The functianality is pretty simple, basically when the bot recives a message from another user containing the phrase "tell me a joke", the bot does a GET request to the Chuck Norris Jokes api(https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random) and sends the value.
